## UI of Simulator

To create a new `.bi` file use the out/assembler.jar (copied from the previous project).

```bash
java -jar out/Assembler.jar \
      group1/mips_simulator/simulator/programs/LoadStore.txt
```

This will create an output file called `output.txt` at the root level of the project. This
output file will be the binary file to use with the MIPS simulator.
