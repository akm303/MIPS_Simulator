/*
A program that reads 20 numbers (integers) from the keyboard, prints the numbers to the console printer, requests a
number from the user, and searches the 20 numbers read in for the number closest to the number entered by the user.
Print the number entered by the user and the number closest to that number. Your numbers should not be 1â€¦10, but
distributed over the range of 0 â€¦ 65,535. Therefore, as you read a character in, you need to check it is a digit,
convert it to a number, and assemble the integer.
